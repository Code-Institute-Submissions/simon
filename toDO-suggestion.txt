to ask:
    - load and cache all the sounds on startup - loading animation 
    - how do i get it to stop registering clicks after a sequence a pressed 
        incorrectly - show yoni the misbehaviour!
            - when simon playing clicks still registering
            - user extra selections can mes up the next simon sequence
    - how responsive does it have to be? causse tapping on the phone would
      trigger other gesture based features.
    - do i need to use jasmine for testing?
    - do i still need to use google maps API or emailJS?   
    - ($arg...) for javascript
