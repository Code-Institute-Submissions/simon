suggestion:
    
    - fully load and cache the website first - no lag for sounds!
    - add a hint button or find a way for the user to be able to cheat (maybe 
    (using the cheat()? )
    - add another "display" to the console to keep track of the steps left
        - eg, "02" to steps left, press another key "01" left 
    - display console:
        - new font - something digital?
        - animation for when it comes on
        - sound for:
            - turn on
            - turn off
            - error
            - success
