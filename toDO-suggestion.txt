to do:
    - dont run simonPlay() function immediately after the player gets it wrong. force them to use hint
    - when the game is WON or LOST, leave simon idle and force player to click "PLAY".
    - move soundThemesObj??
    - load all the sounds on startup and cache eveything - loading animation
    - add  logic for "WIN" - currentLevel == levelsNum - DONE!
    - hover for the buttons!
    - maybe tooltips?
    - how to let the user know about the CTRL key
    - apply animation on the PLAY button when it doesnt have class "reset".
    

to ask:
    - load and cache all the sounds on startup - loading animation 
    - how do i get it to stop registering clicks after a sequence a pressed 
        incorrectly - show yoni the misbehaviour!
            - when simon playing clicks still registering
            - user extra selections can mes up the next simon sequence
    - how responsive does it have to be? causse tapping on the phone would
      trigger other gesture based features.
    - do i need to use jasmine for testing?
    - do i still need to use google maps API or emailJS?   
    - ($arg...) for javascript
