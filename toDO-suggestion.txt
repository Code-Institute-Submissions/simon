to do:
    - resetSimon() should set LEVELS button label and levelsNum variable to default!!!!!
    - move soundThemesObj?? -DONE!
    - load all the sounds on startup and cache eveything - loading animation
    - when the game is WON or LOST, leave simon idle and force player to click "PLAY". - DONE
    - add  logic for "WIN" - currentLevel == levelsNum -- DONE!
    - hover for the buttons!
    - maybe tooltips?
    - how to let the user know about the CTRL key
    - apply animation on the PLAY button when it doesnt have class "reset".
    

to ask:
    - load and cache all the sounds on startup - loading animation 
        - 
    - how responsive does it have to be? causse tapping on the phone would
      trigger other gesture based features.
    - do i need to use jasmine for testing?
    - do i still need to use google maps API or emailJS?   
    - how do i get it to stop registering clicks after a sequence a pressed 
        incorrectly - show yoni the misbehaviour!
            - when simon playing clicks still registering
            - user extra selections can mes up the next simon sequence
    - ($arg...) for javascript
    
    


<input type="number" name="quantity" min="4" max="20"> and  a button to confirm
chnage myscript name    git mv myScript.js main.js

            
            
add some element to the front of the page (maybe with a big z index) to say "loading..."
and then in the part of your js which loads last (such that after its done, 
you are sure that the game is ready), 
add a statement to remove that element (e.g. set `display: none`) (edited)
